# General Assembly and The Opportunity Project Sprint 2023

## Problem Statement

I was chosen as a 2023 TOP Sprint Participant to be part of a team representing General Assembly to take on a specific challenge that the FDA has chosen. The FDA has come up with 4 different prompts/challenges focusing on innovations from the COVID-19 pandemic. The different organizations that applied to take on one or more of these challenges had to choose to focus on a particular challenge, and General Assembly has chosen to take on the following:

1. New modes of testing and care delivery rely in part on patients to input and share health data to provide a complete picture to those using population-level data. ***Yet patients may have questions and concerns regarding the <ins>safety, security, and utility of sharing their health information.</ins>***<br><br>
We challenge sprint teams to ***<ins>create tools and digital resources that increase clarity, transparency, and autonomy regarding health privacy and security in order to empower patients to understand, own, use, and voluntarily share diagnostic data with greater confidence.</ins>***

2. In vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests, such as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 tests, are critical data sources for the healthcare ecosystem. ***But with the advent of new at-anywhere and non-lab based tests, capturing data these tests generate requires innovation and new digital technologies.*** <br><br>
We challenge teams to ***<ins>create tools that integrate emerging technologies, such as image capture and IoT, into IVD testing devices, to help easily capture and transmit this information, while doing so in accordance with best practice data standards.</ins>***
